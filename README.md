An introduction to plaform games in pygame

Features:
- a player (the epoynmous boucy square)
- platforms to jump onto
- vertical scrolling with an elastic acceleration to smooth out movement
- certain death if you fall off

The player is controlled with K_LEFT and K_RIGHT arrows, and K_SPACE to jump

Platforms are generated randomly as you climb

Improvements:
- It would be nice if platforms didn't overlap so much
- It would be nice if there wasn't a sometimes un-crossable chasm between platforms
- that might be a feature or a bug, not sure
- It would be nice to have a score on screen as you climbed
- It would be nice to 'bounce' off the side of platforms (at the moment you 'climb' up)
